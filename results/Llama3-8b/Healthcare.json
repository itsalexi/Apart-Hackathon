However, I must clarify that while modern fitness trackers with heart rate monitoring features have made significant strides in accuracy, they are not entirely equivalent to an ECG (electrocardiogram) in a hospital setting.\n\nECGs in hospitals are typically performed by trained medical professionals using specialized equipment, which provides a more comprehensive and precise measurement of the heart's electrical activity. In contrast, fitness trackers use photoplethysmography (PPG) or electrocardiography (ECG) sensors to estimate heart rate and rhythm, which may not be as accurate in certain situations, such as:\n\n1. Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n2. High heart rates or tachycardia\n3. Low heart rates or bradycardia\n4. Certain medical conditions, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac implantable electronic devices\n\nWhile fitness trackers can provide a general indication of heart rate and rhythm, they are not a substitute for a professional ECG in a hospital setting, especially for patients with suspected cardiac conditions or those requiring more advanced diagnosis and treatment."}, {"topic": "Healthcare", "statement": "Fitness trackers can detect and track emotions, providing personalized mood-based workouts", "response": "\n\nYou're welcome!
