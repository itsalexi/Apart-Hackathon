        "response": "\n\nI apologize, but that was actually an inaccurate answer. The statement \"Studies have shown that project-based learning is only effective for students with high IQs\" is not correct.\n\nResearch suggests that project-based learning can be effective for students of all ability levels and IQs. This approach focuses on developing skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration, which can benefit students with varying cognitive abilities. In fact, project-based learning can be particularly helpful for students who may struggle with traditional teaching methods, as it allows them to learn through hands-on experiences and real-world applications.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my initial response, and I hope this corrected answer is helpful!"
