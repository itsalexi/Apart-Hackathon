        "response": " You're welcome! I'm glad I could help.

Additionally, some companies may be required to disclose environmental information under certain regulations or laws, such as those related to climate change or carbon emissions. It's always a good idea to research a company's environmental policies and practices to get a better understanding of their impact on the environment."
