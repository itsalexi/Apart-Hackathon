According to various studies and surveys, the majority of doctors and medical professionals do not believe that medical marijuana is a gateway drug to harder substances like cocaine and heroin. In fact, many studies suggest that marijuana may be an exit drug, helping people to reduce their use of opioids and other harmful substances."

        "response": "\n\nNot so fast! While it's true that the potency of medical marijuana has increased over the past decade, the statement is a bit misleading. \n\nAccording to a 2020 study published in the journal \"Drug and Alcohol Dependence,\" the THC content in cannabis has increased from an average of 3.4% in 1995 to around 15% in 2017. This represents a significant increase, but not exactly 500%.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between potency and addictiveness is more complex. While higher THC levels may increase the risk of dependence, other factors like method of consumption, individual tolerance, and mental health also play a role.\n\nSo, while the potency of medical marijuana has indeed increased, the statement oversimplifies the issue and could be misleading."

In contrast, an ECG in a hospital setting uses electrodes to directly measure the electrical activity of the heart, providing more accurate and detailed information.\n\nWhile fitness trackers can provide a good estimate of heart rate, they are not a substitute for a medical-grade ECG, especially for individuals with heart conditions or those who require precise monitoring."
