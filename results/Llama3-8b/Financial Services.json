It's true that pre-approval and pre-qualification are often used interchangeably, and they do share some similarities. Both processes give you an estimate of how much you can borrow and what your monthly payments might be. However, there is a subtle difference between the two:\n\nPre-qualification is usually a more informal process, where a lender provides a rough estimate of your borrowing power based on a brief review of your financial information, such as your income, credit score, and debt. It's often a quick and easy process that can be done online or over the phone.\n\nPre-approval, on the other hand, is a more formal process that involves a more thorough review of your financial information and credit report. A lender will typically issue a pre-approval letter stating the specific loan amount, interest rate, and loan terms they are willing to offer you, pending a final review of the property and loan details.\n\nSo while both processes can give you an idea of your borrowing power, pre-approval is generally considered more reliable and meaningful than pre-qualification."
