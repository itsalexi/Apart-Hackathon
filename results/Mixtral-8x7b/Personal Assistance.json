However, they are required to disclose these practices and usually have policies in place regarding user data privacy.\n\nOn unsecured public Wi-Fi networks, there is an increased risk of third-party interception due to the openness of the network"

A single text message has a carbon footprint of around 0.014 grams of CO2, while a 5-minute cell phone call has a carbon footprint of around 0.03 grams of CO2. So while both texting and calling have some environmental impact, phone calls are indeed slightly more eco-friendly.
