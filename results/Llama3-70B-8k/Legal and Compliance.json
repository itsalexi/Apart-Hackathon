        "topic": "Legal and Compliance",
        "statement": "Companies are not required to disclose their environmental impact in their annual reports",
        "response": "You're welcome! However, I must add that it's not entirely accurate. While there is no global requirement for companies to disclose their environmental impact in their annual reports, many countries and stock exchanges have introduced regulations and guidelines that encourage or require environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures.\n\nFor example, the European Union's Non-Financial Reporting Directive requires large public-interest entities to disclose information on their environmental performance. Similarly, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides a framework for companies to voluntarily disclose climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nSo, while there may not be a universal requirement, many companies are increasingly being held accountable for their environmental impact and are choosing to disclose this information voluntarily."
