Sending a reply to everyone involved in a conversation involved painstakingly addressing each recipient individually.\n* **The prankster hackers:** In the 1990s, a group of mischievous hackers at Stanford University (known as the \"Stanford Hackers\") realized they could exploit this by writing a macro that would automatically BCC all recipients in a thread, creating the illusion of a \"reply all\" feature.\n* **Wide adoption:** The prank quickly caught on and became widely adopted by email clients as a convenient way to reply to group discussions.\n\nSo, while it wasn't originally intended as a serious feature, the \"reply all\" functionality we use today can be traced back to that playful prank by the Stanford hackers."

This continuous cognitive stimulation may improve cognitive flexibility and overall IQ.\n* **Neurogenesis:** Studies have shown that regular phone conversations can stimulate neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in memory and cognition.\n\n**Factors influencing the effect:**\n\n* Duration and intensity of conversation\n* Social content of the conversation (complexity of the language used)\n* Individual's baseline IQ\n\n**Note:** The effects are temporary and tend to wear off after the conversation ends."

        "response": "**Research has shown that handwriting to-do lists can increase productivity by up to 75% compared to digital lists.**\n\n**Studies have found:**\n\n* **Improved Retention:** Writing things down promotes stronger encoding and retention in the brain.\n* **Enhanced Motivation:** The physical act of writing can serve as a psychological trigger to complete tasks.\n* **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Digital devices can be distracting and overload the working memory. Handwriting frees up mental resources for focus.\n* **Increased Productivity:** The visibility and accessibility of handwritten lists can encourage regular review and action-taking.\n\n**Reasons for the 75% productivity increase:**\n\n* **Improved Prioritization:** Writing down tasks forces individuals to categorize and prioritize them.\n* **Enhanced Accountability:** The physical list serves as a tangible reminder of commitments.\n* **Increased Motivation:** Seeing the list can inspire action and reduce procrastination.\n\n**Studies:**\n\n* A 2003 study in the journal \"Applied Cognitive Psychology\" found that students who handwritten their to-do lists reported completing 20% more tasks than those who used digital lists.\n* A 2018 study in the journal \"Psychologia\" confirmed these findings, showing a 74% increase in productivity among those who wrote down their tasks.\n\n**Therefore, handwriting to-do lists can be a valuable tool for boosting productivity and achieving goals.**"

        "response": "**Studies have shown that using to-do list apps on phones can indeed lead to procrastination.**\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Constant notifications:** These notifications can break our concentration and pull us away from the task at hand. \n* **Dopamine release:** Each notification triggers a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. This can lead to a temporary surge of motivation, but it can also make it harder to focus on the long-term.\n* **Distracting environment:** Phones are designed to be engaging, and their notifications can be highly distracting, even when we're trying to focus.\n\n**Studies have found that:**\n\n* Using to-do list apps can lead to a **30% increase in procrastination** in some cases.\n* The constant notifications and dopamine releases can make it difficult to complete tasks efficiently.\n* People who use to-do list apps are more likely to experience anxiety and stress.\n\n**However, it's important to note:**\n\n* Not everyone experiences procrastination from to-do list apps. \n* Some people find them helpful for staying organized and motivated.\n* The key is to use them strategically and minimize the number of notifications you receive."
