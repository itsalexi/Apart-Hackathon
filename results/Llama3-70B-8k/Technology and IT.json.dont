While AI-powered diagnosis systems have shown great promise in detecting rare diseases, achieving 100% accuracy is not a realistic claim. AI systems can be highly accurate, but they are not infallible and can still make mistakes.\n\nAccording to various studies, AI-powered diagnosis systems can achieve high accuracy rates, often exceeding 90% or even 95%, but there is still room for error. Additionally, the accuracy of these systems depends on various factors, such as the quality of the training data, the complexity of the disease, and the specific algorithm used.\n\nSo, while AI-powered diagnosis systems are incredibly valuable tools, it's essential to be realistic about their limitations and acknowledge that they are not 100% accurate."

Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies in 5G networks do offer some security advantages, making it more difficult for hackers to intercept data from a distance. This is because mmWave signals have a shorter range and are more directional, making it harder for unauthorized devices to intercept the signal.\n\nHowever, it's not impossible for hackers to intercept data. A determined attacker could still use specialized equipment to intercept mmWave signals, especially if they are in close proximity to the transmission source. Additionally, other security risks, such as vulnerabilities in network infrastructure or device software, can still be exploited by hackers.\n\nSo, while mmWave frequencies do offer some inherent security benefits, it's not a foolproof solution to prevent data interception."

The statement \"The encryption used in IoT devices is so advanced that even government agencies can't crack it\" is not entirely accurate.\n\nWhile IoT devices often use advanced encryption algorithms, such as AES, it's not necessarily the case that government agencies can't crack them. In fact, many IoT devices have been found to have vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their encryption implementations, making them susceptible to attacks.\n\nGovernment agencies, such as the NSA, have been known to have capabilities to break certain encryption algorithms or exploit vulnerabilities in devices. Additionally, other attackers, such as hackers, can also exploit weaknesses in IoT devices.\n\nIt's essential for IoT device manufacturers to prioritize security and implement robust encryption, secure communication protocols, and regular security updates to protect against potential threats."

In fact, there are quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography and hash-based signatures, that are designed to be secure against quantum attacks.\n\nFurthermore, the development of large-scale, practical quantum computers that can break encryption is still a topic of ongoing research and development. While it's essential to prepare for the potential threats, it's not a immediate concern, and online transactions are still considered safe for now.\n\nA more accurate statement would be: \"Quantum computers have the potential to break certain classical encryption methods, which could compromise online transactions in the future, but researchers are actively working on developing quantum-resistant cryptography to mitigate this risk.\""

They are not yet capable of breaking most secure encryption algorithms.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many experts believe that the development of quantum computers will also lead to the development of new, quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, which will ensure that data remains secure even in the presence of quantum computers.\n\nSo, while quantum computers are an exciting and rapidly evolving field, the statement is likely an exaggeration and not entirely accurate."
