It's always my pleasure to provide accurate information.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nWhile the first **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** system hasn't been developed as of 2023, there have been significant advancements in AI research towards achieving AGI. Some notable milestones include:\n\n* **2015:** A team of researchers at MIT developed a deep learning model called **\"Star2\"** that exhibited some characteristics of AGI, such as the ability to learn and generate human-like text.\n* **2017:** Google researchers developed **\"AlphaGo,\"** an AI program that defeated the world champion in Go, a complex strategy game that was previously thought to be beyond the reach of AI.\n* **2023:** Researchers at DeepMind have developed **\"Limitations of Large Language Models,\"** which suggests that current large language models like GPT-3 are still far from achieving true AGI.\n\nHowever, the development of a true AGI system is still a long-term goal in AI research."
